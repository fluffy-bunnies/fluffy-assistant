# fluffy-assistant

fluffy-assistant is an interface for ComfyUI created to assist with rapid, repeated image adjustments. It is intended to metaphorically shuttle pixels between common Stable Diffusion tasks and image editors.

Because it is an AutoHotkey script, it will only work on Windows.

It is currently extremely janky. Please bear with me while I try to make it less janky.

<b>Usage</b>
- Run fluffy-assistant.ahk or fluffy-assistant.exe
- Press CapsLock to toggle the overlay on and off
- Right click on the character in the corner for some basic options
- Right click on the empty images for options or drop image files onto them
- Script can be shut down from the system tray
