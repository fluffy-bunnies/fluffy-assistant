<p>
fluffy-assistant is an interface for ComfyUI created to assist with rapid, repeated image adjustments. It is intended to metaphorically shuttle pixels between common Stable Diffusion tasks and image editors.
</p>

<p>
Because it is an AutoHotkey script, it will only work on Windows. It also requires an instance of ComfyUI to connect to. A display resolution of at least 1920*1080 (100% DPI scaling) is recommended.
</p>

<p>
It is currently extremely janky. Please bear with me while I try to make it less janky.
