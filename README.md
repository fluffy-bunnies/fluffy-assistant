<p>
fluffy-assistant is an interface for ComfyUI created to assist with rapid, repeated image adjustments. It is intended to metaphorically shuttle pixels between common Stable Diffusion tasks and image editors.

<p>
Because it is an AutoHotkey script, it will only work on Windows.
</p>

<p>
It is currently extremely janky. Please bear with me while I try to make it less janky.
